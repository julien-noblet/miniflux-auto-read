# Miniflux Auto Read

A lightweight HTTP service that automatically marks Miniflux entries as read and saves them for later review.

## Overview

Miniflux Auto Read is a companion service for [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app) that helps you manage your RSS feeds by automatically processing unread entries. It marks them as read while saving them to your starred/saved items, keeping your feed clean while preserving articles for later.

**Note:** This service only marks entries as read and saves them. For pushing articles to external services (Pocket, Instapaper, etc.), use Miniflux's built-in integrations.

## Features

- 🚀 Simple HTTP API with two endpoints
- ✅ Health check endpoint for monitoring
- 📖 Bulk process unread entries with one API call
- 🔒 Secure configuration via environment variables
- 📊 Detailed logging and error reporting
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight (written in Go)

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/julien-noblet/miniflux-auto-read.git
cd miniflux-auto-read
go build
```

### Using Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/julien-noblet/miniflux-auto-read@latest
```

## Configuration

The service is configured entirely through environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MINIFLUX_API_URL` | Yes | - | Your Miniflux instance URL (e.g., `https://miniflux.example.com`) |
| `MINIFLUX_API_TOKEN` | Yes | - | Your Miniflux API token |
| `PORT` | No | `8080` | HTTP server port |

### Getting Your API Token

1. Log in to your Miniflux instance
2. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the generated token

## Usage

### Running the Service

```bash
export MINIFLUX_API_URL="https://miniflux.example.com"
export MINIFLUX_API_TOKEN="your-api-token-here"
export PORT=8080

./miniflux-auto-read
```

### API Endpoints

#### Health Check

Check if the service is running and can connect to Miniflux:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-09T14:30:00Z"
}
```

#### Process Entries

Mark all unread entries as read and save them:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/process
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "processed": 42,
  "errors": 0,
  "total": 42
}
```

## Automation
